  client-initiated renegotiation.","The flaw exists because the remote SSL/TLS service does not
  properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols.

  Note: The referenced CVEs are affecting OpenSSL and Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) but
  both are in a DISPUTED state with the following rationale:

  library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a specific environment.

  - Disable recursion

  - Don't allow public access to DNS Servers doing recursion

  - Leave recursion enabled if the DNS Server stays on a corporate network that cannot be reached

  order to find out (snoop) if the DNS server has a specific DNS record cached, and thereby
  deduce if the DNS server's owner (or its users) have recently visited a specific site.

  This may reveal information about the DNS server's owner, such as what vendor, bank, service
  provider, etc. they use. Especially if this is confirmed (snooped) multiple times over a period.

  This method could even be used to gather statistical information - for example at what time does
  the DNS server's owner typically access his net bank etc. The cached DNS record's remaining TTL
  value can provide very accurate data for this.

  DNS cache snooping is possible even if the DNS server is not configured to resolve recursively
  for 3rd parties, as long as it provides records from the cache also to 3rd parties (a.k.a.
  'lame requests').","Sends a crafted DNS query and checks the response.

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
